=resque-alive= adds a Kubernetes Liveness probe to a Resque instance.

How?

=resque-alive= provides a small rack application which exposes HTTP endpoint to return the "Aliveness" of the Resque instance. Aliveness is determined by the presence of an auto-expiring key. =resque-alive= schedules a "heartbeat" job to periodically refresh the expiring key - in the event the Resque instance can't process the job, the key expires and the instance is marked as unhealthy.

** Installation

  Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  #+begin_src ruby
    gem 'resque-alive'
  #+end_src

  And then execute:

  #+begin_src shell
    bundle install
  #+end_src

  Or install it yourself as:

  #+begin_src shell
    gem install resque-alive
  #+end_src

** Usage

  =resque-alive= will start when Resque starts.

  #+begin_src shell
    bundle exec resque
  #+end_src


  #+begin_src shell
    curl localhost:7433
    #=> Alive key is present
  #+end_src

  =resque-alive= can be disabled via the =RESQUE_ALIVE_DISABLED= ENV var:

  #+begin_src shell
    RESQUE_ALIVE_DISABLED=true rake resque:work
  #+end_src

*** Caveats

  =resque-alive= requires a [[https://github.com/resque/resque-scheduler][resque-scheduler]] process to be running in order to schedule the heartbeat Job.

** Development

  After checking out the repo, run =bin/setup= to install dependencies. Then, run =rake spec= to run the tests. You can also run =bin/console= for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

  To install this gem onto your local machine, run =bundle exec rake install=. To release a new version, update the version number in =version.rb=, and then run =bundle exec rake release=, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the =.gem= file to [[https://rubygems.org][rubygems.org]].
